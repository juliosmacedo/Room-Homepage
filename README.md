## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Sharpened my skills for mobile-responsive layouts, and the script integration for the gallery was nice to code.
Good challenge and the result is a pretty neat layout that can be used as a landing page for another business.

### Continued development

Focus more on cleaning the CSS code and CSS transitions are still a bit murky.
